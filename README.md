This is a bunch of simple Exercism exercises.  I started out looking for some good ideas to do coding practice sessions with potential candidates.  Something to sit down and pair program on for a short-time.  Now I've started playing with other languages because it's fun, and sometimes challenging since they are "new" to me.
